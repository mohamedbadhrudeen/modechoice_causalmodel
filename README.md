# Causal Structure Learning of Mode Choice Behavior
Understanding mode choice behaviour using causal structure learning. This was a course project completed by me and [Rishabh Chauhan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=c8NFKrsAAAAJ).

This repository contains R code for the project titled "Understanding Mode Choice Behaviour through Causal Structure Learning". 
The part of the R code - correlation matrix for mixed data (copula estimate.R) - shared here was copied from the 
paper "Learning causal structure from mixed data with missing values using Gaussian copula models" by Cui et al (2019).   

This R code produces two causal structure based one based on Copula PC algorithm, and the other based on Fast Causal Inference(FCI) algorithms. 

Data - National Household Travel Survey 2017 - used for this can be downloaded from https://nhts.ornl.gov/assets/2016/download/Csv.zip
